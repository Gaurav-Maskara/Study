Reading:
1. Total 40 questions in 60 minutes
2. 3 Sections progressively difficult
3. There is one trick -- scan the passages by going through the questions, try to figure out keywords in questions and look for those specific keywords, if found your question above and
                                         below it should also be in the order, recall example : southern Rajasthan because the questions go in order
4. Sentence completion questions --> do only after Fill in the blanks --> Y-N-NG --> short answer
5. Matching Reading questions (Do at the last) --> not in order like other reading questions 
    For the above category you can either scan the passage basis of words in the boxes or on the basis of questions , it depends on the situation 
	(But generally they are easy)
	
6. Table questions :Normally it goes in order , requires scannning technique like other questions ,Very  Easy so good to do at first question
6.1 . Diagram Questions : 
7. Summary fill in the balnks --> these questions are tough , do it at the last of reading comprehension each passages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Follow this order for solving --->fill in the blanks----> mcq type --> summary type at last/ paragraph location / Choose 2-3 from list /Paragraph Location /Heading Type Questions
15. Heading type questions : try to read the first few lines and the last few to guess ,what could be the title or the heading. Also try to pick the small paragphs first
20. Don't waste time reading too much
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Choose 2-3 from list : they are generally not in order and should be done at last 
9. Keep this in mind almost always questions of any particular set goes in order
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Note : Very Important : The words or keywords befor the actual start of any set are very important and would help you to look for the exact word in the whole passage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Paragraph location questions should also be done at last because of the reason that they don't follow sequential order (also I inferred they are somewhat like summary questions)
      Strategy for paragraph location: scanning requirement --> scan for matching language 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. To be done at last : Summay questions (most of the time in order) , Choose 2-3 from List ,  Paragraph location questions, Heading type questions
18. Remember : that most of the questions are in order, so this will be a good strategy to find one aswer and mark the question no there , so since the other questions are in order,
                           you will be sure the next question will be after the present location
19. Remember : For order questions , first mark the keywords (also dates like 1900 , something unique, names , places). 
                           Now you have identified the keyword(1900) , try to locate the easiest ones first in the passage , so that you can locate others by scanning above or below, since they are in order
						   Circle the keywords in question paper

 
21 .Questions that mostly go in order ---> fill in the blanks , short answer, sentence completion , summary questions, table/chart questions, diagram questions, yes no not given , multiple choice
22. Questions type that are not in order ---> paragraph location , matching /classify, pick 2-5
23. Note : sometimes you may get confused, after locating the answer paragraph, that which should be the correct answer.
                   In that situation look for the matching syonymys before and after the blank line to guess the answer

17. Download the resources from the course
18. From the tests answers'  learn some linking words, these words can be reused later while writing your own i.e. sample coherence words :
       Sample : incorporated, ingested, intake, breakfast equaled, digested, similarly, in a like manner, paralled, in intro use oner hundread year (instead of writing 100),
	                    generally speaking, while, respectively, cognizance, with Sweden following a similar general path, fell by about 2.5% over the first 20 years,
						and remained at that level over the next two decades, on the other hand, made slight gains, swelling to about 9% and 10% respectively, 
						surge in more dramatic fashion reaching  aroun 15%, but then a mediocre fall happened, Future prdictions indicate a sudden jump of, 
						skyrocketing,  prognostication, Noteworthy,  if the pie chart is of past use consistently past tense, 
						this report relates to two tables presenting fair trade coffee and banana sales from 1999 to 2004, 
						by and large, coffee sales mushroomed in all countries between 1999 and 2004, countries =territories, mushroomed =climbed, 
						on the whole, lest alone, massive increase, starting from , similarly to the UK, on a final note, commercially transacted, when it comes to,
						
						
19 . Surely download the resources they contain generaly vocab synonyms which you need to learn by heart to increase the vocabulary
20. For sure write the outline before starting to write the answer
21. In Essays : for contrasting you can use : Despite the relevance of the above points , ..................
22. Thesis statement for : Essays
        Eg. Both options offer enticing benefits, but  experienced sources present the better alternative due to common past theme and sounding board benefits
		Eg2: Political administrations should take the lead on scientific investigations based upon lack of bias and owning a governmnet duty to citizens.
		Eg3 : As expressed below , the strength of one-on-one dialogue surpasses text centred because it builds trsut and relationship

6. Question : Describe a child you know . You should say : who this child is and how often you see him or her ? How old this child is ? 
What he or she is like and explain how you feel about this child ?


I am going to talk about my niece. Her name is Adya , she's 3 years old and my elder sister's first child
  
With regards to how often I see her , I'd say it's about once  week

As for what she's like , I'd describe her as intelligent but quite naughty
If  I think how I feel about her , I'd say I'm quite protective
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Bro's math HW

How I feel about her (D)
I. Protective
S. Cn be clumsy
E. Park --hawk idiom

I am going to talk about / ( I would like to talk about) my niece. Her name is Adya, she's 7 years old and she is my elder sister's first child.

I see her about once a week . She goes to school during the week , but all our family usually get together on Sundays for a family meal. In fact, I saw her just a few days ago for our Sunday 
lunch , Along with her two brothers , and we all had a lovely time together.

As for what she's like as a person , I'd describe her as very intelligent , but a bit naughty . I think she takes after her mum in that way , who was just like that when we were kids.
For instance, just the othr day Adya was helping her elder brother with his math homework , but when it came to doing her own , she refused and had a tantrum
I can remeber my sister doing something similar when she was that age .

I guess I tend to feel quite protective about her , which is probably because she's prone to being quite clumsy . She's alredy had quite a few accidents in her time , so its important to keep 
a close eye on her. I took her to park few weeks ago , for example, and had o watch her like a hawk while she was on the swings to make sure she didn't fall off .
Still, she's really fun child to be around and she always make me laugh

Question : Describe a sport you used to do . You should say when and where you did it . How often you did this sport ? who you did this sport with ? and explain what you liked and/or 
                   disliked about this sport ? 

I am going to talk about foot ball , which is a sport I used to play around ten years ago.

In fact I still play it now when I have the opportunity , but not competitively. As a kid I played football all the time . I was part of a local football team , and every Saturday we went to the sports centre 
to compete with the kids from other local teams . I'd been playing for six years by the time I stopped.

It was just once a week we played football , but I wish it was more . I used to look forward to the games every week . I still sometimes think about joining a competitive team as an adult.
I think I probably will someday.

My etammates were all my friends , and we all got along well . Sometimes there were fights and arguments , but these were rare . I remeber our last game together ;
I scored a goal when I was panicking and my friends were so angry , but then I scored at the right end and all that anger disappeared .

I guess I liked football so much because I have quite a competitive spirit , I've always had a lot of drive to win . Football gave me the chance to tap into that drive , it gave me a huge adrenaline rush.

Question : Describe a write you would like to meet . You should say who the writer is ? What you know about this write already ? What you would like to find out about him/ her ?
                     and explain why would you like to meet this writer ?
					 
I am going to talk about Stephen King , who is a writer of horror books and is one of my favourite authors.

I know a few things about Stephen King already . Firstly , I know he came form very humble beginnings . He grew up quite poor and his dad left home when he was a kid .
He wrote prolifically until the time of his breakthrough short story , Carrie , which was written by him on his old typewriter.


If I could meet Stephen King , I'd ask him how he comes up with the new ideas after all this time. He must have writen over fifty books by now. That take a lot of commitment towards work and 
probaly a lot of research . I'd also ask him what his favourite book is .


I guess I'd like to meet Stephen King because he seems like the kind of guy you could learn a lot from . I think he'd have a lot of good advices after all that life experience.

Sample Interview  :
Question : Did you go to secondary school near to wher eyou lived ? Why/ Why not ?
Yes , I did. Well, sort of near . We lived a couple of kilometers from school , so it took only to get there on foot , a few minutes by car.

Question: What did you like about your secondary school ?
The thing I liked most about my secondary school was probably my friends . To be honest , I think the quality of education was quite poor though , but I enjoyed playing football
with my mates at lunch times and they have stayed my friends for life .

Question : Can you tell me about anuthing you didn't like at your school ?
Yes , as I mentioned , I didn't think the quality of education was very good. The teachers there seemed to lack motivation , they weren't good at connecting with the kids. With science in particular
I remeber feeling very disinterested in the subject .

Question : How do you think your school be improved ?
Well, as I have said , the teaching staff could have been better , though maybe they've hired all new staff by now.
Perhaps if the old teachers have been trained more in classroom management , students would have been more engaged .

Question : Did you continue studying after you finished your school .
Yes, I did. I continued my study at IET Lucknow, where I enrolled in Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I went there staright after seconday school, and I was there for 4 years.

Question : In what ways is higher education different from schools ?
Well, firstly , I found that the experince of indepenedent study was totally different to secondary school . You're given much less guidance and have to work out a lot on your own.
and that transition can be pretty difficult. Secondaly, another big difference is the social side . You're meeting new people all the time , which is another world to that secondary school
where you know all your friends . 


Question ::::: Describe something you don't have now but would like to really own it in the future .
You should say what this thing is ? How long have you wanted to own this ? Where you first saw it ? and explain why would you like to own it ?

*How Long (D)
I. A few years
S. Back at unique
S. researching tours

Where first saw it (I)
I. Bike website 
S. Top 10 list 
S. Mine from ebay

Why own it (I)
I. Great breaking 
S. Own non disk
E. A few near misses


I'm going to talk about a bike I'd like to have in the future . This is a touring bike , which mean sits made for long trips, and its called The Himalayan.

I've wanted to own this bike for a few years now, ever since I first became interested in bike touring back when I was in my third year at university . I remeber seeing a particular documentary.
on bike touring , and although the bike in question wasn't being ridden , I ended up doing a lot of research and quickly came across this special bike. 

As , for where I fist saw it , as I just mentioned , I was researching bike touring at the time , checking out a lot of magazines , websites and forums. My first sight of the bike was in a top 10
list of the best websites for touring . It was love at first sight , though I knew I couldn't affort it . I ended up fgetting the cheaper version . , without dislk brakes . second hand off ebay.
My brother and I drove three hours to pick it up , and it was too big for me but I just had to get used to it. I ended up calling it 'The Horse'.

Thinling about why I would like to own it , there is one main reason. As I already have the non disk version , I can already enjoy most of the benefist the bike offers, but I can't benefit from the 
superior braking power of this bike . My bike's brakes are a bit sqiody and I had the disk brakes , I would have felt a fair bit safer. For instance , I've had a few near misses already on my
second- hand bike , and there nothingf more important than safety.








Discussion stage :
Question : Do you think televisions and films can make people want to get new possessions ? Why do they have this effect ?
Answer : Yes, I do . Speaking from experience , there have been a number of times when I have been influenced by television and films in this way , and I am sure other people are no 
different . For example, the new bike I was taling about earlier , all that came through as a result of watching a TV documentary on bike touring . Although, the show 
wasn't advertising a particular bike , I still became hooked on the idea of going bike touring , and ofcourse I needed a new bike to do that . I guess TV and films do this by tapping 
into people's inner desires , but I am not sure it's always intetional . Celebrities are another important part of it , though I have never been really interested in celebrity lives .


Question : Are there any benefits to society of people wanting to get new possessions ? Why do you think this is ?
Answer : Yes, I can think of a few benefits to the society . First , of all when people go shopping and buy new things , this generates profit for businesses . These profits are then taxed 
and the society as a whole reaps the benefits from these taxes such as better health care .
Secondly , such consumerist desires may inspire innovation . For example many of the products that we own today - our laptops, iphones and tablets are the result of our demands
for something original and new . If people didn't want to buy new things , these products might have never been invented.


Question : Do you think people will consider having lots of possessions is a sign of success in future ? Why ?
Answer : I'm not sure about this one . I certainly think it's true many people today consider this a sign of success , but equally there are more and more people who are moving 
towards a more minimal lifestyle. What I hope will happen is that people will consider values like family, friendship and charity more important barometers of success than material 
possessions  but my outlook is a bit more pessimistic . I think people , even more than today , will probably consider material posseions a sign of success , and I think this beacuse
I belive advertising will become ever more agressive and the gap between rich and poor will grow ever wider . I know the future in my view looks bleak . but I hope I am wrong.
